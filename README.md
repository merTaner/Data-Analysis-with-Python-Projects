# Data Analysis with Python Projectss
In this tutorial, I learned how to read data from sources like CSV and SQL and use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to manipulate and visualize data.
By completing these projects, i was demonstrate that i have a good foundational knowledge of data analysis with Python.

### ⭐ Projects I have completed

#### ➡️Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.
The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.

#### ➡️Demographic Data Analyzer
In this challenge you must analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

#### ➡️Medical Data Visualizer
In this project, you will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.

#### ➡️Page View Time Series Visualizer
For this project you will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

#### ➡️Sea Level Predictor
You will analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. You will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
